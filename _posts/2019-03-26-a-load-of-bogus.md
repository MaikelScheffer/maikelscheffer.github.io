### A load of Bogus: Realistic faking in .NET"

In my [previous post](https://abitofbytes.com/c%23,/.net,/unit/testing/2019/03/09/Unit-Tests-In-C.html I went into creating unit tests in way that isn't prone to encouraging self-harm. 

In that post I mostly used AutoFixture and other extensions that extended AutoFixture.  
Since then I've tried out several other frameworks that should help with testing.

One of those is [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus)

In this post I'll show some examples of Bogus use. 

**Used**
- Bogus
- .NET Core
- Shouldly
- xUnit
- Moq

The greatest perk about Bogus is that it has a large collection of preset values that you can make use of using a rule-based setup. 
This allows for clear, predictable test-data.
